1. Developed a math reasoning agent by fine tuning phi-3-mini large language model using unsloth. The math reasoning agent answers questions related to calculus, algebra, etc. Applied low-rank adaptation (LoRA) during fine tuning of LLM.
2. The tough_math_reasoning_dataset_500.json file contains 500 input-output pairs (500 questions and answers related to mathematics).
3. To run the project:  
   A) Make sure the tough_math_reasoning_dataset_500.json file is in the same directory as the ipynb file. 
   B) Run the ipynb file.  
   C) Google collaboratory (with T4 GPU) is preferred.
